        <h3>How To Prepare The Strawberry Crunch Cake</h3>

                <p><strong>Step 1</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Coat 2 (8-inch) round cake pans with baking spray 
                            with flour and line bottoms with parchment.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                <p><strong>Step 2</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Whisk together flour, gelatin, baking powder, salt, and baking soda in a bowl.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                <p><strong>Step 3</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Beat butter at medium speed until creamy, 2 to 3 minutes in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the 
                            paddle attachment. Gradually add sugar, beating until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Add eggs, 1 
                            at a time, beating on low speed and scraping down sides of bowl as needed, until just combined. Beat 
                            in vanilla.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                <p><strong>Step 4</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Add flour mixture in 3 additions alternately with buttermilk, beginning and ending with flour mixture 
                            and beating on low speed just until combined after each addition. Divide batter evenly between prepared
                            pans.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                <p><strong>Step 5</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Bake in the preheated oven until a wooden pick inserted in center comes out clean, about 40 minutes.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                            Cool in pans on a wire rack for 10 minutes; remove cakes from pans and cool completely on a wire rack, 
                            1 to 1 1/2 hours.

                        (bits of strawberry and cookie should still be visible), about 12 pulses. Drizzle in butter and pulse about
                        5 times to combine.
