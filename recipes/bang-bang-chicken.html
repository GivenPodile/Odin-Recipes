        <h3>Discription</h3>

            <p>
                This bang bang chicken is a wonderful Americanized version of an extremely popular <strong><i>Sichuan Chinese   
                </strong>dish. With twice-fried chicken, you get the crispy fried breading you'd expect, and the bang bang sauce
                 drizzle makes the entire dish spectacular. 
            </p>

        <h3>How To Prepare The Bang Bang Chicken</h3>
            <p><strong>Step 1</strong></p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Whisk together milk and egg in a large bowl until well combined. Add chicken; stir to coat and allow to
                        marinate for 15 minutes. Drain and discard egg mixture.
                    </li>
                </ul>

            <p><strong>Step 2</strong></p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Combine potato starch, flour, salt, pepper, and shichimi in a medium bowl. Pour into a large plastic 
                        resealable bag. Add chicken; seal the bag and shake until chicken is well coated. 
                    </li>
                </ul>
                
            <p><strong>Step 3</strong></p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Heat 2 inches oil in a deep saucepan over medium heat to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
                    </li>
                </ul>

            <p><strong>Step 4</strong></p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Working in batches of about 5 to 8 pieces at a time, cook chicken in hot oil for about 90 seconds. Remove
                        to a paper towel-lined plate; keep each batch separate.
                    </li>
                </ul>

            <p><strong>Step 5</strong></p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Increase oil temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). The oil should be continuously boiling at this 
                        point. Carefully re-add the first batch of chicken and fry for another 90 seconds. Remove to another paper
                        towel-lined plate. Repeat with remaining batches of chicken.
                    </li>
                </ul>

            <p><strong>Final Step</strong></p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Mix together mayonnaise, honey, sweet chili sauce, and gochujang in a large serving bowl until combined. 
                        Toss fried chicken with sauce to coat.
                    </li>
                </ul>
